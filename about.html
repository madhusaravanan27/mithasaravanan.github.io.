        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Fueled by creativity and a love for tradition, I bring a unique blend of passion and curiosity to all that I do. Originally from Chennai, India—a city rich in temples, coastal beauty, and vibrant cultural heritage—I grew up immersed in an environment that celebrates both art and community. As a trained Bharatnatyam dancer, I find joy in storytelling through movement, connecting deeply with my heritage and expressing myself through this classical art form.</p>

        <p>My love for culture also extends into the kitchen, where I explore diverse cuisines through cooking and baking. From recreating the bold flavors of Chennai to experimenting with dishes from around the world, I see food as a way to connect, create, and share memorable experiences with others. With every step I take, whether dancing, cooking, or exploring new passions, I’m driven by a curiosity to learn, connect, and celebrate the beauty in both the familiar and the new.</p>
