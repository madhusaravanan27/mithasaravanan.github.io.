        <h1>Reflecting on My Journey in the Applied Data Science Program</h1>

        <p>Reflecting on my time in the Applied Data Science program, I can see how transformative it has been both academically and professionally. I came into the program with a clear set of expectations about the skills I wanted to gain, but the experience exceeded them in ways I hadn’t anticipated. I’ve developed not only a strong foundation in data science but also an advanced understanding of big data management, cloud infrastructure, and the technical and ethical aspects of data handling. Each course and project pushed me further, giving me a well-rounded skill set and setting me on a clear path toward a career in data engineering.</p>

        <h2>Expectations and Reality</h2>
        <p>When I joined this program, my primary goal was to gain expertise in data handling, analytics, and modeling, with a focus on mastering the end-to-end data science lifecycle. I expected to learn technical skills in programming and data processing, as well as best practices for building predictive models and communicating insights effectively. Above all, I wanted to gain hands-on experience working with large datasets in both structured and unstructured forms and to familiarize myself with big data ecosystems and cloud platforms. I hoped to come away with the ability to independently build data pipelines, conduct meaningful analysis, and develop predictive models that could drive decision-making in a variety of contexts.</p>

        <p>Looking back, the program delivered on these expectations and more. I now have experience across the data science lifecycle—from collecting, storing, and processing data to visualizing results and building models. Each course was a stepping stone, building on previous learning outcomes and preparing me for the next challenge. My favorite classes, Advanced Big Data Management (IST769) with Professor Michael Fudge and Data Warehouse (IST722) with Professor Chad Harper, were particularly instrumental in shaping my career aspirations. These classes introduced me to NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, and Neo4j and taught me about dimensional modeling, data warehouse architecture, and business intelligence. Through these subjects, I found my passion for data engineering, and I’m excited to take these skills into a professional setting.</p>

        <h2>Achieving Learning Outcomes through Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="teal-text">Collecting, Storing, and Accessing Data:</span> I gained expertise in data collection and storage through projects that required working with large datasets and utilizing various storage solutions. For example, in the <em>VBAY Database Data Warehouse Project</em>, I designed and implemented a data warehouse using Snowflake and DBT. This project required creating fact and dimension tables to support business processes such as sales, location analysis, and bidding.</li>
            <li><span class="teal-text">Creating Actionable Insights:</span> In the <em>Crime Classification Based on Geographical Area</em> project, I analyzed crime patterns in Los Angeles, identifying demographic trends, crime severity, and geographical hotspots. This project underscored the importance of understanding the end-user needs and tailoring analysis to be actionable and relevant.</li>
            <li><span class="teal-text">Applying Visualization and Predictive Modeling:</span> In the <em>Visual Exploration of Natural Disasters and Economic Impact in the USA (2000-2020)</em> project, I created interactive dashboards to explore the effects of natural disasters. This project helped me understand how visual analytics can make complex information accessible and understandable for broader audiences.</li>
            <li><span class="teal-text">Programming Proficiency in R and Python:</span> I frequently used Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, reinforcing my programming skills in a practical context. Python has become my primary tool for data analysis, and I am confident in using libraries like Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Plotly for a variety of data tasks.</li>
            <li><span class="teal-text">Communicating Insights:</span> Effective communication of insights was a constant focus. In the <em>VBAY Database Data Warehouse Project</em>, I not only created the data models but also presented the outcomes through reports and visualizations, making the technical data processes understandable for non-expert stakeholders.</li>
            <li><span class="teal-text">Applying Ethical Principles in Data Science:</span> Ethical considerations were woven into the program, particularly regarding data privacy, fairness, and transparency. In the <em>Crime Classification Based on Geographical Area</em> project, where sensitive demographic data was used, I applied techniques to anonymize and ensure ethical handling of information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Projects and Their Contributions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="teal-text">VBAY Database Data Warehouse Project:</span> This project contributed to my education by giving me practical experience with data warehousing and cloud infrastructure. By building a dimensional model and using Snowflake and DBT, I learned how to organize data for scalable and efficient analysis.</li>
            <li><span class="teal-text">Crime Classification Based on Geographical Area:</span> The crime classification project allowed me to delve into machine learning and geospatial analysis, using clustering and classification models to identify trends in crime data.</li>
            <li><span class="teal-text">Visual Exploration of Natural Disasters and Economic Impact:</span> This project taught me about data storytelling through interactive dashboards. I used Tableau to create visualizations that made complex time-series data and economic impacts accessible and actionable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Internships and Additional Experiences</h2>
        <p>In addition to my coursework, I did not have the opportunity to do internships. However, I worked on several additional projects that were instrumental in helping me understand client needs, manage expectations, and deliver data solutions within set deadlines. These experiences allowed me to develop strong skills in cross-functional collaboration and taught me to approach data science with a problem-solving mindset—one that balances technical precision with an awareness of business objectives.</p>

        <h2>Favorite Class and Surprising Elements of the Program</h2>
        <p>While I enjoyed all the courses, my favorite was <strong>Advanced Big Data Management (IST769)</strong> with Professor Michael Fudge. This class introduced me to NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, and Neo4j, broadening my understanding of big data management. One of the biggest surprises of the program was the emphasis on data ethics, which taught me the importance of transparency, fairness, and bias mitigation in data science.</p>

        <h2>Best Part of the Program and Future Applications</h2>
        <p>The best part of the program was the practical focus, which enabled me to gain hands-on experience in areas directly relevant to my career goals. Each project built on previous knowledge, and by the time I completed the program, I felt prepared to step into a data engineering role with confidence. Overall, the Applied Data Science program has equipped me with the tools, knowledge, and ethical grounding to excel in data engineering. I am excited to make a positive impact in the data science field.</p>
